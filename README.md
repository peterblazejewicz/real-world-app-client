# Read World App - Client application

This is Dotnet Kestrel based version Read World App Angular 2 client.

The client code is built with `angular-cli` and prepared for hosting with Dotnet Kestrel server.

The project comes with Azure web site `Kudu` deployment script as the client code is built during deployment (`ng build -prod`).

The Dotnet web site uses custom hosting configuration to match `angular-cli` built-in patterns for building and bundling client side code.
